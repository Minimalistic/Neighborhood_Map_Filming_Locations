Goal of the project was to develop a single page application featuring a map of populated with information relevant to the application. Project also needed additional functionality including highlighted locations on the map and third-party data about those locations and various ways to browse the content.

I ultimately settled on having a map of New York and populating it with a number of markers for filming locations for well known movie scenes.  To satisfy the third-party data, I used [TheMovieDB's](https://www.themoviedb.org) third-party API.

## Getting Started
Currently there is no live running site of this application, to run it on your own machine you can [download the repo](https://github.com/Minimalistic/Neighborhood_Map_Filming_Locations).  

Then, using a web browser open `index.html`

## Attributions
This application uses Google Maps API to display the map for the filming locations and markers.

TheMovieDB's third-party API is used to pull information related to the most recently clicked filming location to display the average user vote rank (1-10) for that specific film.

Finally, an article on [UntappedCities.com](https://untappedcities.com/2016/09/30/10-of-the-most-iconic-film-scene-locations-in-nyc/9/) was used as a guide to decide on what to populate on the map application.
